# React Native Continuous Integration

This repository provides a comprehensive guide and configurations for setting up continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines specifically tailored for React Native applications. By leveraging tools like Husky, lint-staged, Jenkins, and SonarQube, you can ensure fast, reliable, and automated builds, testing, and deployment for your React Native projects.

## Introduction

This repository aims to provide a step-by-step guide to setting up an efficient CI/CD pipeline for your React Native applications. The following tools and services will be utilized:

- **Husky**: A tool for configuring Git hooks, particularly pre-commit hooks, to enforce code quality and consistency before each commit.
- **lint-staged**: A library that runs linters on only the staged files, making the pre-commit checks faster and more efficient.
- **Jenkins**: A popular open-source automation server that enables the creation and management of CI/CD pipelines.
- **SonarQube**: A platform for continuous inspection of code quality, detecting bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells, and providing detailed reports and recommendations.

## Getting Started

### Husky

1. Install Husky as a development dependency in your React Native project:

   ```bash
   npm install husky --save-dev
   ```

2. Add the following configuration to your `package.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "husky": {
       "hooks": {
         "pre-commit": "lint-staged"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

### Lint-staged

1. Install lint-staged as a development dependency in your React Native project:

   ```bash
   npm install lint-staged --save-dev
   ```

2. Add the following configuration to your `package.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "lint-staged": {
       "*.{js,jsx}": [
         "eslint --fix",
         "git add"
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

### Jenkins

1. Install and configure Jenkins on your server or local machine. Follow the official [Jenkins Installation Guide](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/) to get started.

2. Install the necessary plugins in Jenkins, such as the [GitHub Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/github/), [SonarQube Scanner Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/sonar/), and any other required plugins for your specific project.

3. Create a new Jenkins pipeline and configure it with your GitHub repository.

4. Add a `Jenkinsfile` to your React Native project to define the pipeline stages, such as building the application, running tests, and performing static code analysis with SonarQube.

### SonarQube

1. Install and configure SonarQube on your server or local machine. Follow the official [SonarQube Installation Guide](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/setup/install-server/) to get started.

2. Configure your React Native project with a `sonar-project.properties` file, specifying the required properties such as `sonar.projectKey`, `sonar.projectName`, `sonar.sources`, and any other necessary settings.

3. In your `Jenkinsfile`, add a stage for running the SonarQube Scanner to analyze your code and send the results to your SonarQube.
